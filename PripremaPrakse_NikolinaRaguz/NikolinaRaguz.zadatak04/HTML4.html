            <h1>Coastal Job: Underwater Criminal Investigator</h1>
            Mike Berry has been diving for bodies and evidence for more than three decades, helping solve high-profile crimes around the world.
            Mike Berry has been an underwater criminal investigator for more than 35 years. In 1987, he launched his company, 
            Underwater Criminal Investigators, and trains police forces all over the world.

            From ocean dives that push the limits of depth and time to crawling on my hands and knees in shallow polluted creeks, 
            I’ve been involved in over 1,000 underwater investigations. I’ve found bodies and weapons within minutes, and I’ve spent weeks 
            looking for evidence in cold cases. My longest recovery operation lasted three months and involved a contract killing. I don’t 
            even know how many bodies or weapons I’ve recovered over the years. Lots.

            Growing up, I watched TV shows about scuba divers and stared at a black-and-white photograph of my dad standing knee-deep 
            in water holding a speargun. I always thought that one day I was going to do that.

            After I got out of the military, I got certified as a diver and joined the Virginia State Police. When I was training, 
            the trooper I was riding with asked if I wanted to go on a dive for some stolen handguns. I didn’t even know there was a 
            police dive team. Of course, I was interested right away. Out of all the people diving, I was the only one who found a gun. 
            I was hooked.

            I joined the dive team as soon as I could and was always the first one in the water and the last one out. After a few years, 
            I became an instructor and later started my training company, Underwater Criminal Investigators. It exploded because there 
            wasn’t anybody in the country teaching police diving.

            Most of the dives are very challenging and dangerous. The sites are not your beautiful coral reefs with tropical fish and 
            100-percent visibility. A gun isn’t sitting there on the sand for you to see it. It’s below the silt layers, and we have to 
            get down there and search by feel. A lot of our waterways are contaminated and we have to wear special drysuits and full face masks. The idea is to not let the water touch you and definitely not to ingest it.

            Evidence is always going to be hiding in the water. It surrounds us and it’s an easy dumping ground. You don’t have to 
            dig a hole—you just flick your wrist. The people who put these items in the water never think that there are divers trained 
            to go down there and find them. I’ve had murderers tell me, “You’ll never find it.” And then we do.

            It’s about helping other people. I get to use my love for diving to solve someone’s problem—it could be an investigator 
            looking for a murder weapon that was thrown off a bridge, or it could be a family that lost a loved one and won’t have 
            closure until the body’s recovered.

            The strangest thing I ever found was a wooden box duct-taped to a brick. In the box was a tiny bag with some candles and a male 
            voodoo doll with a needle right in its groin. You don’t find that every day. I pulled out the needle and told everyone on the 
            boat that somewhere a man was thanking me.

            <h1>Scientists just discovered 125 million-year-old dinosaur dandruff</h1>
            It’s no secret dinosaurs possessed their own fair share of dirty habits—most bodies can get pretty gross, no matter the species. 
            But dandruff? Nobody really saw that coming.

            A new study published in Nature Communications illustrates the discovery of some 125 million-year-old dinosaur dandruff 
            fossils. The findings aren’t just a quick excuse for making a bad Head and Shoulders quip, but also actually explain a mechanism 
            by which dinosaurs did something nearly universal: shed skin.

            “Probably nobody much thought about how dinosaurs shed their skin before,” says Mike Benton, a professor of vertebrate 
            paleontology at the University of Bristol and a coauthor of the new study. The new findings “tell us that dinosaurs were like 
            birds, shedding their skin in small flakes.”

            The findings stem from the analysis of feathers from the Cretaceous period in China, from three different dinosaur species 
            (Microraptor, Beipiaosaurus, and Sinornithosaurus) and the early bird Confuciusornis. Benton and his colleagues had been 
            working with the specimens since 2007, and the characterization of the skin flakes is just their latest milestone.

            All animals molt, or rid themselves of old skin and feathers and hair, so they can grow larger and new face environmental 
            challenges with a fresh new coat of exterior tissue. Before the new findings, there was a dearth in understanding how 
            dinosaur skin worked and how the mighty beasts managed to shed it. The most prevalent theory was that molting in dinosaurs 
            occurred in pieces, as it does in their closest modern relatives (birds and crocodiles). The whole-sheath skin shedding 
            technique used by snakes and some lizards would have made less sense for dinosaurs, given that these species are more distantly 
            related.

            But during the group’s work using regular and electron microscopes, the researchers kept coming across strange white blobs 
            located all over the plumage. Upon further investigation using ion beam microscope (which revealed the internal structure of 
            the flakes), the team identified the specks as corneocytes: tough cells composed of twisted fibers of keratin, found in both 
            modern birds as well as human dandruff.

            “We avoided the word dandruff in the scientific paper since it’s a term usually applied to skin flakes between the hair of 
            humans,” says Benton. “But this is what we’re seeing, trapped between shafts of feathers in the fossil birds and dinosaurs. 
            They are tiny flakes of surface skin, measuring 1 to 2 millimeters across.” The team believes dandruff probably evolved during 
            the Middle Jurassic period, during which there was a bloom in new feathery dinosaur species.

            Beyond the fact that apparently dinosaurs would be embarrassed to wear black clothing without a good head scrub, the detail 
            of the skin structure from the fossil shows us the species studied “were warm-blooded, but not as greatly as modern birds,” 
            says Benton. Flying can produce enormous amounts of metabolic heat, and modern day birds use skin shedding as way facilitate 
            evaporative cooling. The dinos, in contrast, possess more tightly packed corneocytes that are not as freely shed, so cooling 
            through this mechanism would have been more limited. This suggests these dinosaurs probably generated lower amounts of heat 
            during flight, if they could fly at all.

            Danny Barta, a comparative biology researcher at the American Museum of Natural History who was not involved with the study, 
            calls the findings “groundbreaking, particularly because we’ve never had such clear insight into the skin of feathered dinosaurs 
            before.”

            “The study confirms yet another shared feature between non-avian dinosaurs and birds, and it’s particularly exciting to see 
            these similarities emerge in most regions of the anatomy, all the way down to the microstructural level,” Barta says.

            Moving forward, Benton and his team want to extend their study of feathers and skin to other dinosaur specimens and see how 
            common these features are, especially in species that are more closely related to modern birds. But personally, I’m hoping 
            this paper is just the first in a new field of study focused on bad dinosaur hygiene—and that the results make it into the 
            third “Jurassic World” movie. Don’t pretend you wouldn’t pay to see Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard battle against T. rex 
            BO for 120 minutes.

                <h1>This AI Calculates at the Speed of Light</h1>
                Signals in the brain hop from neuron to neuron at a speed of roughly 390 feet per second. Light, on the other hand, 
                travels 186,282 miles in a second. Imagine the possibilities if we were that quick-witted.
    
                Well, computers are getting there. Researchers from UCLA on Thursday revealed a 3D-printed, optical neural network that allows 
                computers to solve complex mathematical computations at the speed of light. In other words, we don’t stand a chance.
    
                Hyperbole aside, researchers believe this computing technique could shift the power of machine learning algorithms, the math 
                that underlies many of the artificial intelligence applications in use today, into an entirely new gear.
                Deep learning is one of the fastest-growing corners of artificial intelligence research and implementation. Machine learning 
                is how Facebook recognizes you and your friends; it’s how computers diagnose cancer from images of human tissues; it’s how your 
                credit score is determined. If your job title falls under the title of “paper pusher” AI will probably be putting you out of a job.
    
                Artificial neural networks garner their brainy comparisons because the mathematical logic of the algorithms are analogous to how 
                scientists think the brain functions. In fleshy brains, we have an entangled mess of neurons that perform one of two functions: 
                They either “fire” or they don’t; they’re binary. But string 100 billion neurons together in an interconnected, infinitely 
                tangled morass of thought spaghetti, and you have yourself a very powerful computer.
    
                Artificial neural networks work on the same logic, but the “neurons” are just highly simplified mathematical 
                equations — data is fed in, calculated and a solution is spit out. Artificial neural networks contain thousands upon 
                thousands of these mathematical neurons, and they’re arranged in layers. When a neuron performs a calculation, it passes 
                the solution to a neuron in the next layer, where that neuron performs a calculation and passes on the solution in turn.
    
                Researchers train artificial neural networks by feeding them a huge set of solutions to a specific task, say, identifying 
                pictures of trees. By showing the neural network images of trees — the solution — the algorithm “learns” what a tree is. 
                As it goes, the algorithm automatically adjusts the math that occurs at each neuron until the output matches the training 
                set solutions. When a computer identifies an object, it’s simply spitting out a mathematical solution that’s presented as a 
                probability (i.e. there’s a 95 percent chance that object is a tree).
                You need an incredible amount of computing power to make an artificial neural network worth all the trouble. And right now, 
                the computing equivalent of a V8 engine is the graphics processing unit, or GPU. These little circuit board workhorses make 
                video games look beautiful, as they accelerate the rapid fire mathematical calculations required to render images smoothly. 
                If you string chains of these GPUs together you can multiply their power and mine cryptocurrencies or run artificial 
                intelligence programs. It’s no wonder there’s currently a shortage of these things.
    
                But, if you think about it, even the finest GPUs on the market are still manufactured with silicon and copper. Information 
                travels as electrical impulses along intricate circuit board highways. But researchers led by UCLA’s Xing Lin 3D-printed a 
                multi-layered neural network that relays information via pulses of light. And sending information via light, rather than via 
                electric pulses along metallic roadways, is like the difference between driving a car or flying a jet to your destination.
    
                Now, researchers didn’t entirely replace the GPU. Their optical neural network only performed the recognition task — the 
                entire training step was performed via computer. In other words, it’s not an entire system, but it’s a start.
    
                To demonstrate their device’s performance, they tuned their algorithm to identify handwritten numbers by feeding it 55,000 
                images of the numbers zero to nine. Then, they tested the optical neural network on 10,000 new images. It correctly identified 
                the images with 91.75 percent accuracy, performing the calculations at the speed of light.
                Rather than adjusting the math at each neuron, researchers say the optical network tunes its neurons by changing the phase and 
                amplitude of light at each neuron. And rather than having a 1 or 0 as the solution at a neuron, each optical neuron either 
                transmits or reflects an incoming light to the next layer. Researchers published their findings Thursday in the journal Science.
    
                The researchers have taken AI hardware in an interesting new direction, because they say it’s possible to pair optical 
                neural networks with computers so they work in parallel and share the workload. Researchers believe these components, 
                dubbed diffractive deep neural networks (D2NNs), could be easily scaled up using advanced 3D-printing methods to add additional 
                layers and neurons. Another plus: A D2NN is very power efficient, and that’s big because current GPUs consume an awful lot of 
                electricity and generate quite a bit of heat.
    
                Merging GPU and optical D2NNs could be a faster, more energy efficient engine for AI applications of the future — like, say, 
                identifying Russian propaganda in your newsfeed.

                <h1>You can actually be allergic to exercise</h1>
                Joe O’Leary went to dinner with his parents at around 8 p.m. one Wednesday in March of 2015. He split a pizza, topped 
                with tomatoes and peppers, with his mom. Then he set out for the gym and hopped on the elliptical. But about a half-hour 
                into the workout, he started feeling weird. “My eyes were watering, I was having trouble breathing,” he says. “In another 
                five minutes I was struggling to breathe. I looked behind me into the mirror, and my eyes were swollen—every part of my face 
                was swollen.”
    
                O’Leary was rushed to the emergency room and pumped full of steroids and antihistamines. He’d had an allergic reaction, 
                but not just to what he’d eaten for dinner: it was the combination of food and exercise that did him in. Doctors quickly 
                diagnosed him with a condition called exercise-induced anaphylaxis, where a reaction to an allergen only happens in 
                conjunction with exercise. If he combines them with exercise, O’Leary will have an anaphylactic reaction to tomatoes, 
                peppers, soy, and nuts.
    
                Exercise-induced anaphylaxis was first described in 1979, and probably affects around 50 in every 100,000 people. While 
                awareness of the condition among allergists has gone up, researchers and doctors still don’t know exactly why it occurs, 
                says Maria Castells, an allergist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
    
                For between 30 to 50 percent of people, the reaction comes from combining certain types of food and exercise. For others, 
                strenuous activity triggers a reaction to drugs like aspirin. Some women only experience the phenomenon when they’re at the 
                point in their menstrual cycle with high levels of the hormone estrogen, because it can bind to the cells involved with an 
                allergic reaction. “There are a variety of things that it might be,” Castells says. “And for a proportion it’s nothing, 
                really, just the exercise itself.”
    
                The amount of exercise needed to trigger a reaction varies from person to person, Castells says. It generally takes more 
                to cause anaphylaxis in someone who is relatively fit than someone who isn’t in great shape. Almost all types of exercise, 
                like running, dancing, or biking, have been reported to cause anaphylaxis—though there haven’t yet been any reports of anyone 
                having a reaction after swimming, Castells says.
    
                It's still not exactly clear what causes the connection between exercise and anaphylaxis. There are a number of working 
                theories about the mechanism involved, tied to the physiological changes that happen in the body during exercise. 
                Increased blood flow might push sensitive immune cells around the body, for instance. Or perhaps certain proteins in the 
                gut change their behavior during exercise, interacting with food in ways that could cause an allergic reaction. And since 
                exercise increases the absorption of material from the gastrointestinal tract, it's possible that there are simply more 
                allergens able to make their way into the body during a workout.
    
                It’s difficult to test those theories, though, because the condition is difficult to recreate in a laboratory setting. “So there’s 
                no mouse model and no human model of the ideas,” Castells says. There are a number of groups trying to develop a model, but 
                they need more time.
    
                Luckily, Castells says, diagnosis is straightforward. And once people are diagnosed, their symptoms can be managed the same 
                way any allergy is managed—by avoiding allergens (the foods and drugs, ideally, as opposed to the exercise trigger) and 
                carrying EpiPens. “A lot has been done to advance the clinical piece of it, so it’s a better known syndrome,” she says.
    
                O’Leary didn’t get a ton of information after his diagnosis, but his allergist was able to give him the basics. To cope, 
                O'Leary cut all of his allergens out of his diet completely. Even though he could avoid a reaction by waiting to exercise 
                after eating tomatoes or nuts, he prefers to just avoid them all together. He would rather sacrifice ketchup than risk having 
                an unexpected attack.

                <h1>You have to admit that this horseshoe crab looks just like Darth Vader</h1>
                A long time ago, in a watery area not so far away... dinosaurs were just getting started, and a horseshoe crab that looked 
                an awful lot like Darth Vader’s helmet was chilling in shallow waters on Idaho’s coastline (yep, 245 million years ago, 
                Idaho had a coast.)
    
                In a paper published in the German journal Neues Jahrbuch für Geologie und Paläontologie, paleontologists identify a 
                245-million-year-old fossil as a new species of horseshoe crab they dub Vaderlimulus tricki.
    
                For what it’s worth, it’s not the first time that someone has noticed that the dome of a horseshoe crab’s shell looks kind 
                of like Darth Vader’s helmet. It’s not even the first time that a species has been named after this particular Star Wars 
                character. This crab joins houseflies, wasps, a slime-mold beetle, an Australian mite, and an ant in being named after Darth Vader.
                Why so many Vaders? And while we're at it, why are oh-so-many animals (and plants and fungi and bacteria) named after famous 
                people?
    
                Well, I’m writing about it, and you’re reading about it. There's your answer.
    
                If this ancient fossil hadn’t had quite such a cool name, would you want to know more about the critter? Maybe you’re a 
                huge horseshoe crab fan, and you’d be 100% excited even without a pop culture reference. But maybe you’re just a huge 
                Star Wars fan, and you want to get your fix before the next movie comes out. Either way, that’s ok. These species names 
                are basically taxonomical clickbait, which garner newly-discovered species a little attention. But that doesn't mean they 
                don't deserve it.
    
                This particular Vader was named when the daughter of one of the authors noticed the resemblance between the horseshoe crab 
                and the Sith-Lord-formerly-known-as Anakin Skywalker's helmet.
    
                This specimen belongs to a long-extinct family of horseshoe crabs that lived in the Triassic called Austrolimulidae. The family 
                was first identified by a single fossil found in Australia and described back in 1955.
    
                These horseshoe crabs (not actually related to crabs) had what paleontologists consider to be bizarre shapes for horseshoe 
                crabs today. They think that’s because these animals, unlike their modern salt-water-loving relatives were experimenting 
                with living in fresh or brackish water. It didn’t work out.
    
                Today there are only four species of horseshoe crab living in the world, and they’re not having the easiest time of it. 
                Some are perishing in mass die-offs that biologists are still struggling to understand. Others are serving as involuntary 
                blood donors to the medical industry, with their valuable blue blood used in life-saving medical tests. It’s rough out 
                there for a horseshoe.
    
                But these critters have weathered five mass extinctions in their 450 million years on Earth. Some, like Vaderlimulus tricki, 
                only lasted briefly, but their distant relatives were more resilient. Now, all they have to do is survive humans.
    
                Luckily, if you live near a coast, you can help them out. These animals have trouble turning themselves over if they land 
                on their backs. If you see a modern horseshoe crab stranded on its back, flip it over and help it get on with it’s life.
    
                And if you see a horseshoe crab fossil out in nature, call a paleontologist or a natural history museum. Fossils like 
                Vaderlimulus tricki are incredibly rare, and you could help discover something completely new. And who knows, maybe you'll 
                even convince scientists to name it after your favorite villain.

            It said in a statement that it "does not tolerate hate speech".

            Facebook has also "unpublished" the InfoWars page on its platform for "using hate speech".

            On Monday, Spotify told the BBC that it too had removed The Alex Jones Show from its podcast listings.

            It had previously removed a small number of episodes for violating its "hate content policy".

            Mr Jones has been widely criticised for repeating conspiracy theories that the 9/11 attacks in New York were staged by the US 
            government.

            He has also claimed that many of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre were actors. The parents of two children shot in 
            that attack are suing him for defamation, saying he had made "false, cruel, and dangerous assertions".

            While Apple did not host the InfoWars podcasts on its own servers, its iTunes and Podcasts apps made the programmes easily 
            accessible to millions of people.

            Five of the six InfoWars-related shows are no longer available on iTunes, with all episodes removed.

            Apple no longer links to series such as The Alex Jones Podcast and War Room in its apps. However, the Real News series remains on 
            iTunes.

            In a statement, Apple told Buzzfeed News: "We have clear guidelines that creators and developers must follow to ensure we provide 
            a safe environment for all of our users.

            "We believe in representing a wide range of views, so long as people are respectful to those with differing opinions."

            Several other apps and social media platforms have also taken action against InfoWars content.

            In July, YouTube removed four videos from Mr Jones' channel, which has more than 2.4 million followers.

            In the deleted videos, Mr Jones criticised Muslim immigrants to Europe and also denounced a transgender cartoon.

            YouTube said it had "long-standing policies against child endangerment and hate speech" but InfoWars claimed the the videos had 
            been deleted because they were "critical of liberalism".
